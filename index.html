    <p>I always find it difficult to label myself as just one or two things because I have so many interests and passions. What drives me the most is bringing people happiness by helping people learn how to take their health back with the power of quality food.  With proper nutrition, many chronic diseases can be reversed and I am very happy to share what I have learned over the years.</p>
    <p>I love technology, specifically how we have access to information.  The sky is the limit on what you can learn if you have the drive.  I enjoy meeting others who share similar passions.  Please reach out below if you're a fellow hero like me!</p>
